Which branch?
======
"chibiscreen" is the branch to use. Other branches seen here are not relevant.

Orchard-K22
======

Orchard is the internal codename for Kosagi's chibiOS-on-kinetis platform.

This port is to the K22FN512, which is a Cortex-M4, based on ARMv7E-M.


Debugging and Loading Code
==========================

This project is configured to load code using openOCD. The K22FN512 is bleeding
edge on openOCD so you need to incorporate the watchdog timer patch that has
yet to make it to release for the project to work. 

Starting OpenOCD
----------------

Connect Orchard to the target machine.  Here, we assume that Orchard will be
connected to UART4 on a Novena.  You will need a newer kernel that contains
properly muxed pins, as UART4's CTS and RTS are muxed as UART pins in earlier
kernels, and not GPIO pins.  For more information on the pinout, see
comments in sysfsgpio-novena.cfg.

    sudo openocd -f sysfsgpio-novena.cfg

If you're using a Raspberry Pi, use the sysfsgpio-rpi.cfg script.  The
pinout is documented in the board-specific file.

    sudo openocd -f sysfsgpio-rpi.cfg

If you're flahsing boards for the first time, add '-c noinit' before the
board-specific config file.  E.g.:

    sudo openocd -c noinit -f sysfsgpio-rpi.cfg

You can then connect to OpenOCD either via telnet (to load code or do basic
debugging functions), or via gdb (in order to debug applications.)


Loading code
------------

To load code, telnet to the OpenOCD daemon and run the "program" command.  You
may program ELF files, which obviates the need to specify loading offsets:

    telnet localhost 4444
    program build/orchard.elf
    reset
    exit


Debugging
---------

To debug code, connect via GDB.  Note that GDB sometimes refuses to connect
to a device that is running, so you may need to connect first via telnet
and halt the board:

    telnet localhost 4444
    reset halt
    exit

To connect via GDB, specify the ELF file for the current program and connect
to localhost:

    gdb build/orchard.elf
    target remote localhost:3333
    fg

You can then break into the current program by hitting Control-C.  It is
possible to set breakpoints, investigate threads, and examine areas
of memory.  Two hardware breakpoints are supported, meaning you can break
somewhere in program code and then "step" or "stepi" through execution.
If you have two breakpoints set up already, you will not be able to step
through code as gdb won't be able to insert a breakpoint after the current
instruction.

You can load new code from GDB.  This will load a new program into GDB, and
will flash a new program onto the board and halt the CPU:

    load build/orchard.elf
